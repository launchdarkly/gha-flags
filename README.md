## Output

The values of the request flags are stored on the step outputs with the flag key.

**Keys:**

Flag keys used in this GitHub Action must contain only alphanumeric characters, `-`, or `_`.

**Values:**

> Outputs are Unicode strings, and can be a maximum of 1 MB. The total of all outputs in a workflow run can be a maximum of 50 MB.

### Basic

This example evaluates flag keys of different types and prints their values.

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```yaml
name: Evaluate LaunchDarkly flags
on: push
jobs:
  eval-flags:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Evaluate flags
        id: flags
        uses: launchdarkly/gha-flags@v1.0.1
        with:
          sdk-key: ${{ secrets.LD_SDK_KEY }}
          flags: |
            test-boolean-flag
            test-string-flag
            test-number-flag
            test-json-flag
      - name: Print flag values
        run: |
          echo ${{ steps.flags.outputs.test-boolean-flag }}
          echo ${{ steps.flags.outputs.test-string-flag }}
          echo ${{ steps.flags.outputs.test-number-flag }}
          echo ${{ toJSON(steps.flags.outputs.test-json-flag) }}
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

### Dynamic context key

This example evaluates a flag for a context. Here, the LaunchDarkly context key is the username of the GitHub user who initiated the workflow run.

_Read more: [GitHub Actions Contexts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts)_

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```yaml
name: Evaluate LaunchDarkly flags
on: push
jobs:
  eval-flags:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Evaluate flags
        id: flags
        uses: launchdarkly/gha-flags@v1.0.1
        with:
          sdk-key: ${{ secrets.LD_SDK_KEY }}
          flags: favorite-animal
          context-key: ${{ github.actor }}
      - name: Favorite animal
        if: steps.flags.outputs.favorite-animal != 'idk'
        run: echo "${{ github.actor }}'s favorite animal is a...${{ steps.flags.outputs.favorite-animal }}"
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

### Use value in expression

This example evaluates a flag key and uses the value in an expression in a subsequent step.

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```yaml
name: Evaluate LaunchDarkly flags
on: push
jobs:
  eval-flags:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Evaluate flags
        id: ld
        uses: launchdarkly/gha-flags@v1.0.1
        with:
          sdk-key: ${{ secrets.LD_SDK_KEY }}
          flags: test-boolean-flag
      - name: If true
        if: steps.flags.outputs.test-boolean-flag == 'true'
        run: echo "It's true"
      - name: If false
        if: steps.flags.outputs.test-boolean-flag == 'false'
        run: echo "It's false"
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

### Parse output string to types

This example illustrates how output values are stored as strings. You can parse them to JSON or a JSON data type using [fromJSON()](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#fromjson).

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```yaml
name: Evaluate LaunchDarkly flags
on: push
jobs:
  eval-flags:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Evaluate flags
        id: ld
        uses: launchdarkly/gha-flags@v1.0.1
        with:
          sdk-key: ${{ secrets.LD_SDK_KEY }}
          flags: test-boolean-flag
          - name: If true
            if: fromJSON(steps.flags.outputs.test-boolean-flag) == true
            run: echo "It's true"
          - name: If false
            if: fromJSON(steps.flags.outputs.test-boolean-flag) == false
            run: echo "It's false"
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

### Setting custom contexts

If you would like to include additional custom properties in your context object you may specify environment variables with the `LD_` prefix. All values will be treated at strings.

By default, all metadata associated with the workflow run is saved in custom properties.

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```yaml
name: Evaluate LaunchDarkly flags
on: push
job:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Evaluate flags
        id: ld
        uses: launchdarkly/gha-flags@v1.0.1
        with:
          sdk-key: ${{ secrets.LD_SDK_KEY }}
          flags: test-boolean-flag
        env:
          LD_group: beta
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

### Use with GitHub deployment environments

_Read more: [Using environments for deployment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)_

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```yaml
name: Deploy to environment
on: push
job:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - name: Evaluate flags
        id: ld
        uses: launchdarkly/gha-flags@v1.0.1
        with:
          sdk-key: ${{ secrets.LD_SDK_KEY }} # configure environment-specific secret
          flags: test-boolean-flag
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

### Disable analytics events

This example evaluates flag keys without sending events to LaunchDarkly.

_Read more: [Analytics events](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/concepts/events/)_

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```yaml
name: Evaluate LaunchDarkly flags
on: push
jobs:
  eval-flags:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Evaluate flags
        id: flags
        uses: launchdarkly/gha-flags@v1.0.1
        with:
          sdk-key: ${{ secrets.LD_SDK_KEY }}
          flags: test-boolean-flag
          send-events: false
```

## About LaunchDarkly

- LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard. With LaunchDarkly, you can:
  - Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
  - Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
  - Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
  - Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
- LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies. Check out [our documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk) for a complete list.
